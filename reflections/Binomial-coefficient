1. Recursive method.
	This method is usable when we require single value.
	Time complexity : O(n * k)

2. DP approach 2D array method.
	This method is used when we want some or all the binomial co-efficients. 
	Time complexity: O(n * k)
	Space complexity: O(n * k)


3.DP approach- 1D method (space optimized)
	This method is used when we want one row of co-efficient.
	Time complexity : O(n * k)
	Space complexity : O(k)
